Looking at the period formula which is $T = 2\pi \sqrt{ \frac{m}{k} }$, that $T$ and $\sqrt{ m }$ are directly proportional. Using this formula, $\frac{\sqrt{ m }}{t}$ is equal to $\frac{\sqrt{ k }}{2\pi}$ and the slope of the graph of $T$ vs $\sqrt{ m }$ will yield $\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{ k }}$. Therefore, the quotient of the slope divided by $2\pi$ raised to the -2 power will yield k.



$$
\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{ k }} = \frac{T}{\sqrt{ m }}
$$
$$
\frac{T}{2\pi \sqrt{ m }} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ k }}
$$
