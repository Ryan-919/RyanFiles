Meteorologists are interested in the relationship between minimum pressure and maximum wind speed of hurricanes. The minimum pressure, in millibars, and maximum wind speed, in knots, were collected for a random sample of 100 hurricanes from the year 1995 to the year 2012. A regression analysis of maximum wind speed on minimum wind pressure produced a 95 percent confidence interval of (-1.42, -1.20) for the slope of the least-squares regression line. Which statement is a correct interpretation of the interval?  
A  
The probability is 0.95 that wind speed will decrease, on average, between 1.20 knots and 1.42 knots for each millibar increase in minimum pressure.  
B  
The probability is 0.95 that a different sample of 100 hurricanes will result in an increase, on average, of wind speed between 1.20 knots and 1.42 knots for each millibar increase in minimum pressure.  
**C**  
We can be 95% confident that wind speed decreases, on average, between 1.20 knots and 1.42 knots for each millibar increase in minimum pressure.  
D  
We can be 95% confident that wind speed increases, on average, between 1.20 knots and 1.42 knots for each millibar increase in minimum pressure.  
E  
We can be 95% confident that, for any sample of hurricanes, the wind speed will decrease, on average, between 1.20 knots and 1.42 knots for each millibar increase in minimum pre
