Hi! I'm Ryan and from Cary, NC. I'm super excited to be joining CMU in the Fall and plan to study ECE. In my free time, I enjoy staying active and spending time outdoors (biking, hiking, backpacking, etc.). I love listening to new music and can listen to just about anything (Death Grips and Swans are currently on repeat). Naturally, I try to go to as many concerts as I can. I'm also excited to explore new restaurants in Pittsburgh and my favorite food is sushi!
