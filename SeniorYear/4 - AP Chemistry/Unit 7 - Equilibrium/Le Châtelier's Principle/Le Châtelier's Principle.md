## Le Châtelier's Principle
### Overview
- #### Le Châtelier's Principle
	- ###### Definition
		- Changing the reaction conditions of a system at equilibrium can cause the system to no longer be in equilibrium
			- Known as stressing an equilibrium system
		- The system will shift to reduce the stress and re-establish equilibrium
	- ###### Stressing
		- Can be stressed by changing:
			- Molarity
			- Partial Pressure
			- Temperature
			- Volume
			- Pressure
		- **Catalysts** do **NOT** stress the system
			- increases the rate in both directions
		- **Solids** do **NOT** stress the system
			- Solids aren't included in an equilibrium constant expression
- #### Changing Molarity
	- $K$ remains constant
	- ###### Reactant Increase
		- System shifts to consume excess reactant and form product
	- ###### Product Increase 
		- System shifts to consume excess product and form more reactant
	- ###### Dilution
		- Affects side with most aqueous substances more
- #### Changing Pressure and Volume
	- $K$ remains constant
	- ###### Relation to moles of gas
		- Pressure is **directly proportional** to moles of gas
			- **Increasing pressure** (or decreasing volume) on an equilibrium system causes the system to shift to the side with the **fewest** moles of gas
			- Decreasing would do the opposite
- #### Changing Temperature
	- $K$ does NOT remain constant
	- ###### Addition of heat
		- Favors endothermic direction
			- Endothermic direction consumes heat to help relieve the stress
	- ###### Change in K
		- K increases or decreases depending if more products are formed or reactants
- #### Relating Reaction Quotient
	- ###### Introducing stress
		- At equilibrium: $Q = K$
		- When stressed: $Q ≠ K$
		- **Changing molarity/partial pressure, volume, and pressure**
			- Products and reactants redestribuet until $Q = K$
		- **Changing temperature**
			- Products and reactants redestribuet until new $K$ is established
	- ###### Changing molarity/partial pressure
		- If $\uparrow$ product or $\downarrow$ reactant concentration
			- $Q > K$
		- If $\downarrow$ product or $\uparrow$ reactant concentration
			- $Q < K$

### Examples
- #### Changing Molarity
	- ###### Increase reactant
		- $K_C = \frac {[FeSCN^{2+}]} {[Fe^{3+}][SCN^-]}$
		- Adding SCN<sup>-</sup> will cause more $FeSCN^{2+}$ to be produced
		- Response is an increase in products and decrease in reactants
		- **Graph**
			- ![[Graphical Representation of Stress Example 1]]
	- ###### Decrease Reactant
		- $K_C = \frac {[FeSCN^{2+}]} {[Fe^{3+}][SCN^-]}$
		- Add OH<sup>-</sup> will react with Fe<sup>3+</sup> to form Fe(OH)<sub>3(s)</sub>
			- Decrease \[Fe<sup>3+</sup>]
		- System shifts to form reactant and consume product
		- **Graph**
			- ![[Graphical Representation of Stress Example 2]]
		- Response is an increase in reactants and decrease in products
- #### Changing Pressure
	- ###### Increasing/Decreasing Pressure
		- $2\ CH_4(g) + O_2(g) \leftrightarrow 2\ CH_3OH(g)$
		- 3 moles of gas on reactant side vs. 2 moles on product side
		- **Increasing Pressure**
			- Causes product to be formed and reactant to be consumed
		- **Decreasing Pressure**
			- Causes reactant to be formed and product to be consumed
- #### Changing Temperature
	- ###### Adding heat
		- $heat + Co[H_2O]^{2+}_6(aq) + 4\ Cl^-(aq) \leftrightarrow CoCl^{2-}_4(aq) + 6\ H_2O(l)$
		- Addition of heat will favor endothermic direction (consuming reactants to form products)
			- heat is consumed to relieve the stress
		- $K_{new} > K_{old}$
	- ###### Removing heat
		- $heat + Co[H_2O]^{2+}_6(aq) + 4\ Cl^-(aq) \leftrightarrow CoCl^{2-}_4(aq) + 6\ H_2O(l)$
		- Removal of heat will favor exothermic direction (consuming products to form reactants)
			- heat is produced to relieve the stress
		- $K_{new} < K_{old}$
		-
