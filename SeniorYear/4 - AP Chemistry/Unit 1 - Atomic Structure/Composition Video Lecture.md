## Composition Video Lecture
#### Percentage Composition
- Ratio of the molar mass of the element to the molar mass of the compound times the # of moles of the element
- **Ex.** The active ingredient in some antiperspirants is aluminum chlorohydrate, Al<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>5</sub>CI. Analysis of a 2.000-g sample of antiperspirant yields 0.334 g of aluminum. What percent (by mass) of aluminum chlorohydrate is present in the antiperspirant? (Assume there are no other compounds containing aluminum in the antiperspirant.)
	- Convert g of Al to moles, then moles of Al<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>5</sub>Cl, then g of Al<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>5</sub>Cl 
	- now divide by the 2 g sample of antiperspirant and multiply by 100
- **Ex.** A 5.0 g sample of a mixture CaCO<sub>3</sub> and SiO<sub>2</sub> contains 1.5 g Ca. What is the % CacO<sub>3</sub> in the mixture?
	- $\%\  CaCO_{3} = \frac {g\ CaCO_{3}} {g\ sample} * 100$
	- $1.5\ g\ Ca * \frac {1\ mol\ Ca} {4.1\ g\ Ca} * \frac {1\ mol\ CaCO_{3}} {1\ mol\ Ca} * \frac {100.1\ g\ CaCO_{3}} {1\ mol\ CaCO_{3}} = 3.74\ g\ CaCO_{3}$
	- $\%\ CaCO_{3} = \frac {3.74} {5.0} * 100 = 74.8\%$ â†’ $75\%$
#### Empirical vs. Molecular Formulas
- [[Ionic compounds]] are written as Empirical Formulas
	- lowest possible ratios of atoms in compound
- [[Covalent compounds]] can be written as Molecular Formulas
	- can be multiple of ratio of atoms in compound
- ###### Determining EF given %s or grams
	1. % --> g (assume 100 g sample and simply drop %)
	2. g --> mol
	3. divide all moles by the smallest value
	4. multiply by an integer to obtain whole numbers
		1. if ratio is 0.5, multiply by 2
		2. if ratio is 0.33, multiply by 3
		3. etc.
- ###### Given molecular weight and asked for MF
	- ...determine the molar mass of EF and how many times it goes into molecular weight to get molecular weight.
	- then multiply all subscripts in EF by molecular weight
	- Molecular Formula = (Empirical Formula) * n
- **Ex.** An oxide of phosphorus is 43.7% P and has a molecular weight of 284 g/mol. Determine the molecular formula for the compound.
	- 43.7% P --> 43.7 g P * 1/30.97 mol/g = 1.41104 mol P / 1.4... = 1 --> 1 * 2 = 2
	- 100 - 43.7 = 56.3 g O * 1/16 mol/g = 3.51875 mol O / 1.4... = 2.49 --> 2.5 * 2 = 5
		- EF: P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>
	- mass<sub>molecular</sub> = 141.94 g/mol
	- $\frac {molecular\ weight} {empirical\ weight}$ = $\frac {284} {142}$ = 2
	- P<sub>2*2</sub>O<sub>5*2</sub> = **P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10</sub>** 
#### Hydrates
- **Hydrate** - a compound with water as part of its crystalline structure
	- H<sub>2</sub>O can be boiled off to form...
- **Anhydrate** = a hydrate that has lost its water
