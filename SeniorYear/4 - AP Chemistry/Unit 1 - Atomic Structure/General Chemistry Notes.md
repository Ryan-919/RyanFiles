## General Chemistry Notes
### History of Atom
- **Democritus**: first proposed the concept of indivisible particles called "atoms." Although Democritus lacked evidence, his idea persisted and eventually led to further scientific exploration. 
- **Arab scientists**: refined techniques to purify substances, laying the groundwork for the understanding of elements
- **Antoine and Marie-Anne Lavoisier**: In the 1700s, built on Arab discoveries, identifying elements as fundamental substances that cannot be broken down further. 
- **John Dalton**: In the early 1800s, experiments suggested that elements are composed of tiny, indivisible units—atoms—whose sizes are consistent within each element but differ between elements. Dalton's findings were later supported by Albert Einstein and Jean Perrin, who provided mathematical and experimental confirmation of atoms' existence.
- **20th century**: advancements in technology, such as the scanning tunneling microscope, allowed scientists to visualize atoms directly. These discoveries confirmed that atoms, the fundamental building blocks of matter, exist and can even be split into smaller components.

### Periodic Table
- #### Groups/Families
	- ###### A elements
		- **Group 1** - 1 valence electron, + charge, alkali metals (excluding hydrogen)
		- **Group 2** - 2 valence electrons, + charge, alkaline earth metals
		- **Group 3** - 3 valence electrons, + charge
		- **Group 4** - 4 valence electrons, + charge
		- **Group 5** - 5 valence electrons, -3 charge
		- **Group 6** - 6 valence electrons, -2 charge
		- **Group 7** - 7 valence electrons, -1 charge, halogens extremely reactive
		- **Group 8** - noble gases, very stable
	- ###### Common elements to remember:
		- Will add A elements later
		- **Common B elements** - Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ag, Cd, Hg, Au, Pt, Pd
		- **Common inner transition elements** - Th, U
	- ###### Metal vs. Nonmetal
		- Look for staircase
			- <u>B</u>
			- Al | <u>Si</u> 
			-       Ge | <u>As</u> 
			-               Sb | <u>Te</u>
			-                       Po | At
		- Elements left of line are metals, like to form cations (+ ion) by giving away electrons
		- To the right are nonmetals, like to form anions (- ion) by taking away electrons
		- On the line are metalloids
			- Properties in between that of metals and nonmetals
			- semiconductors
			- Boron, **Silicon**, **Germanium** Arsenic, Antimony, Tellurium

### Compounds
- #### Types of Compounds
	- **Ionic Compounds** - Formed from metal and nonmetal or polyatomic ion
	- **Molecular compounds** - Formed from both nonmetals 
- #### Naming Compounds
	- ###### Prefixes
		- **mono** - 1
		- **di** - 2
		- **tri** - 3
		- **tetra** - 4
		- **penta** - 5
		- **hexa** - 6
		- **hepta** - 7
		- **octa** - 8
		- **nona** - 9
		- **deca** - 10
	- ###### Molecular Compounds
		- Use prefixes for second element
		- CO<sub>1</sub> - Carbon Monoxide
		- N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> - Dinitrogen Pentoxide
		- SCl<sub>6</sub> - Sulfur Hexachloride
	- ###### Ionic Compounds
		- Don't use prefixes
		- KI - Potassium Iodide
		- MgBr<sub>2</sub> - Magnesium Bromide
		- CaO - Calcium Oxide
		- SrF<sub>2</sub> - Strontium Fluoride
- #### Ionic Compounds
	- ###### Polyatomic Ions
		- **Common ones** are SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, CN<sup>-</sup>, OH<sup>-</sup> NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, MnO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>, Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub><sup>2-</sup>
		- Na<sub>2</sub>So<sub>4</sub> - Sodium Sulfate
	- ###### Transition Metals
		- Can have different charges, leading to a slight change in naming
			- FeCl<sub>2</sub> - Iron Chloride?
			- FeCl<sub>3</sub> - Iron chloride?
		- Simply equate the charge of the transition metal to the nonmetal/polyatomic ion 
			- Cl<sub>2</sub> --> Cl has a -1 charge meaning Cl2 has a -2 charge
			- Fe in FeCl2 must have a +2 charge
			- Indicate this in naming with roman numerals: 
				- Iron (II) Chloride
				- Iron (III) Chloride
