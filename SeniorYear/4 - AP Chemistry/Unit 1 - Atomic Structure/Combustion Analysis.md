## Combustion Analysis
#### What is a combustion reaction
- Starts with a hydrocarbon and oxygen → carbon dioxide + water
	- C<sub>x</sub>H<sub>y</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> → CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O
- Since all the carbon from the hydrocarbon ends up in the CO2 formed and all the hydrogen from the hydrocarbon ends up in the water formed, we can deduce the formula of the original hydrocarbon by collecting the masses of both products
	1. grams CO<sub>2</sub> → moles CO<sub>2</sub> → moles C
	2. grams H<sub>2</sub>O → moles H<sub>2</sub>O → moles H
	3. divide by smallest number of moles → subscripts for hydrocarbon
- Some hydrocarbons also contain Oxygen
	- C<sub>x</sub>H<sub>y</sub>O<sub>z</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> → CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O
	- All the carbon still ends up in carbon dioxide and all the hydrogen still needs up in water, but oxygen is in both reactants and both products
	- To find the grams of oxygen present in the hydrocarbon: 
		- g sample - g C - g H = g O
#### Example
1. A compound contains only carbon and hydrogen. A 1.45 g sample is burned and produces 2.25 g of water and 4.40 g of carbon dioxide. Determine the empirical formula for the hydrocarbon
	- **Convert** grams of CO<sub>2</sub> and grams of H<sub>2</sub>O to moles of C and H respectively
		- $4.40\ g\ CO_{2} * \frac {1\ mol\ CO_{2}} {44.01\ g\ CO_{2}} * \frac  {1\ mol\ C} {1\ mol\ CO_{2}} = 0.0999772779\ mol\ C$
		- $2.25\ g\ H_{2}O * \frac {1\ mol\ H_{2}O} {18.02\ g\ H_{2}O} * \frac  {2\ mol\ H} {1\ mol\ H_{2}O} = 50.2497225305\ mol\ H$
	- **Divide** by lower value (mol C) and multiply by 2 to get whole numbers
		- C subscript: 1 → 2
		- H subscript: ~2.5 → 5
	- C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub> is our answer
- A 5.00g sample of an oxygen containing hydrocarbon is combusted, yielding 9.57g carbon dioxide and 5.87g water. What is the empirical formula of this compound?
	- **Convert** grams of CO<sub>2</sub> and grams of H<sub>2</sub>O to grams of C and H respectively
		- $9.57\ g\ CO_{2} * \frac {1\ mol\ CO_{2}} {44.01\ g\ CO_{2}} * \frac  {1\ mol\ C} {1\ mol\ CO_{2}} * \frac {12.01\ g\ C} {1\ mol\ C} = 2.6115815\ g\ C$
		- $5.87\ g\ H_{2}O * \frac {1\ mol\ H_{2}O} {18.02\ g\ H_{2}O} * \frac  {2\ mol\ H} {1\ mol\ H_{2}O} * \frac {1.01\ g\ H} {1\ mol\ H} = 0.65801332\ g\ H$
	- **Find** grams of oxygen present by subtracting the mass of C and H from the sample
		- 5 g - 2.6... - 0.64... = 1.730405222 g O
	- **Convert** grams of O, H, and C to moles
		- $1.730405222\ g\ O * \frac {1\ mol\ O} {16\ g\ O} = 0.1081503264\ mol\ O$
		- $0.65801332\ g\ H * \frac {1\ mol\ H} {1.01\ g\ H} = 0.6514983351\ mol\ H$
		- $2.6115815\ g\ C * \frac {1\ mol\ O} {12.01\ g\ O} = 0.2174505794\ mol\ C$
	- **Divide** by lower value (mol O) and multiply by  to get whole numbers
		- O subscript: 1
		- H subscript: 6
		- C subscript: 2
	- C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O is our answer
