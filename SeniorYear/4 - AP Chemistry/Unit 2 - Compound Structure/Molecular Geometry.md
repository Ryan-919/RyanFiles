### Hybridization
- #### Definition and Atomic Orbitals Review
	- ###### Definition 
		- A model of bonding used to explain the 3d placement of atoms in a molecule
		- Mixing atomic orbitals to form new hybrid orbitals
		- Applies to Be, B, C, N, O
		- **Ex.** s<sup>1</sup>p<sup>3</sup> = s + p + p + p
	- ###### Atomic Orbitals and Shapes
		- An orbital tells you the probability of finding an electron somewhere within an atom
			- According to **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle**, we can't know the exact location of an electron
		- **s orbital:** sphere-shaped
			1. Only 1 type
		- **s orbital:** dumbell-shaped
			1. p<sub>x</sub> - x axis
			2. p<sub>y</sub> - y axis
			3. p<sub>z</sub> - z axis
		- 
- #### Sigma and Pi Bonds
	- ###### Sigma (σ) bond
		- 1 per bond (whether single, double or triple)
		- Form from direct end-to-end orbital overlap on the internuclear axis (directly between the 2 nuclei)
		- All orbitals (s, p, d, hybrid orbitals, etc.) are capable of end-to-end overlap and sigma bond formation
	- ###### Pi bond (π) bond
		- $(\#\ of\ bonds) - 1$
			- 0 for single bonds, 1 for double, 2 for triple)
		- Form through orbital overlap above and below the internuclear axis
		- Pi bonds can only form after a sigma bond has already formed
		- Cannot form pi bonds from s orbitals; pi bonds are most **commonly formed from p-orbitals**, but can also be done with d and f orbitals
- #### Examples
	- ##### Carbon Examples
		- ###### Explaining hybridization of Carbon
			- **Valence electrons:** 2s<sup>2</sup> 2p<sup>2</sup>
				- **2p:** <u>↑_</u> <u>↑_</u> __ __
				- **2s:** <u>↑↓</u>
			- Must hybridize between 2s and 2p orbitals
				- **2sp<sup>x</sup>**
				- **2:** comes from the energy level
				- **s and p:** comes from the 2 sublevels
				- **x:** number of orbitals/bonds used in the hybridization
					- **ex.** C in CH<sub>4</sub> would have 2sp<sup>3</sup> because 4 bonds with hydrogen
						1. s
						2. p
						3. p
						4. p
				- **ex.** Four 2sp<sup>3</sup> hybrid orbitals derived from combining energies of one 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals
					- this would result in a **tetrahedral shape** as each hybrid orbital repels each other with **equal force** resulting in **identical bond angles** (109.5°)
		- ###### CH<sub>4</sub> (single bond)
			- **4 bonds** with hydrogen means four 2sp<sup>3</sup> hybrid orbitals
			- This results in a **tetrahedral shape** as each hybrid orbital repels each other with **equal force** resulting in **identical bond angles** (109.5°)
		- ###### C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> (double bond)
			- **H<sub>2</sub>C=CH<sub>2</sub>**
			- Each C atom is identical and has **3 σ** bonds and **1 π** bond
			- A pi bond comes from the overlap of unhybridized p orbitals so the C atom only **hybridizes three orbitals**
				- Three 2sp<sup>2</sup> hybridized orbitals
					- exist on a plane
				- The remaining, unhybridized 2p orbital is for the π bond
					- exist perpendicular to the 2sp<sup>2</sup> orbitals
			- **Bonding the molecule**
				- Each C atom is 2sp<sup>2</sup> hybridized
					- The sigma bond occurs with 2sp<sup>2</sup> orbital overlap
				- **π bond:** The top and bottom lobes (remember p orbitals are dumbell-shaped) overlap above and below the axis of the sigma bond forming a single π bond.
					- **σ bonds occur** along the **axis between nuclei** while the π bond occurs above and below the σ axis, where the p orbital lobes have overlapped
				- Each C atom also bonds to 2 H atoms by overlapping with both carbon's other 2sp<sup>2</sup> hybrid orbitals creating four more sigma bonds in total
			- **Shape**
				- Each Carbon has a trigonal planar geometry, thus the whole molecule exists in a plane with the single π bond above and below the plane
		- ###### C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> (triple bond)
			- **H-C≡C-H**
			- Each C atom is identical and has 2 σ bonds and 2 π bonds
			- Since pi bonds come from p orbitals, and we need 2 pi bonds, **two 2p orbitals** have to remain unhybridized
				- **2p<sub>x</sub> orbital (dumbell-shaped):** 1 electron
				- **2p<sub>y</sub> orbital (dumbell-shaped):** 1 electron
			- The remaining single 2s orbital and single 2p orbital will hybridize forming  **two 2sp hybrid orbitals** with 1 electron each
			- **Bonding the molecule**
				- 2sp orbitals from both carbons overlap, forming a **σ bond**
				- π bonds overlap in the x and y plane (**perpendicular** from each other)
				- Finally, 2 hydrogen atoms will overlap with the remaining 2sp orbitals from each carbon atom
		- ###### NH<sub>3</sub> (1 lone pair)
			- **N valence electron configuration**:
				- 2p: <u>↑_</u> <u>↑_</u> <u>↑_</u>
				- 2s: <u>↑↓</u>
			- 1 lone pair and 3 single bonds
				- These **four electron dense regions** mean that the hybridization is **2sp<sup>3</sup>**
				- Since there are **5 valence electrons**, one of the four 2sp<sup>3</sup> hybrid orbitals have a pair of electrons
			- The **3 sigma bonds come from the sp<sup>3</sup> orbitals with a single electron**, so they can pair up with the electrons of the hydrogen atoms
			- **The remaining electron pair is a lone pair**
			- As with the sp<sup>3</sup> hybridization in carbon, nitrogen's hybrid orbitals spread out in a **tetrahedral shape**
		- ###### H<sub>2</sub>O (2 lone pairs)
			- **O valence electron configuration**:
				- 2p: <u>↑↓</u> <u>↑_</u> <u>↑_</u>
				- 2s: <u>↑↓</u>
			- 2 lone paris and 2 single bonds 
				- **4 electron dense** regions means hybridization is **2sp<sup>3</sup>**
				- 6 valence electrons means 2 of the 4 sp<sup>3</sup> orbitals have an electron pair
			- The 2 **sigma bonds** come from the sp<sup>3</sup> orbitals with a single electron, so they can pair up with the electrons of the hydrogen atoms
			- The **2 eletron pairs** represent the **2 lone pairs**
			- Again, oxygen's hybrid orbitals spread out in a **tetrahedral shape**
			-
