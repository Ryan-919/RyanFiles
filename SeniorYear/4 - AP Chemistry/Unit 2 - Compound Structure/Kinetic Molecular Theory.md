## Kinetic Molecular Theory
### Kinetic Molecular Theory
- #### Definition
	- Summarizes the ideal behavior of gases
	- Particles have random, continuous motion
	- Collisions are perfectly elastic (no stickiness)
	- Particles have negligible volume
	- Constant temperature = constant average kinetic energy
- #### Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution
	- ###### Definition
		- Shows how particle speeds are distributed in a sample
		- **x-axis:** shows particle speed. Faster particles are to the right
		- **y-axis:** shows how frequently that particle speed is found in the sample
		- **Area under the curve** is constant and equal to 100% of the particles in the sample

	- ###### Comparing temperatures
		- As **temperature increaes**, more of the particles have **higher speeds**, and fewer have lower speeds

	- ###### Comparing gas masses
		- **Larger proportion of massive gases move more slowly**, so the curve is mostly to the left
		- **Less massive gases move faster on average**, so the curve is more to the right and flattens
