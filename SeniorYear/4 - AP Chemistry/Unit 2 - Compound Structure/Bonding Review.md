## Bonding Review
### Ionic Bonds
- #### Metals vs. Nonmetals
	- **Metals** have low ionization energies, they prefer to lose electrons and become cations
	- **Nonmetals** have high electronegativities and prefer to gain electrons to become anions
	- **Example NaCl** - formed with Na cation and Cl anion
- #### Naming and Predicting Charge
	- **Cations** - Simply add the word ion after the atom name (ex. sodium ion)
	- **Anions** - replace ending of element name with -ide (ex. chloride, oxide)
	- Charge is the group number
	- Remove from highest level and subshell
	- **Latice Energy** - energy required to separate an ionic solid into individual separat gaseous ions
### Covalent Bonds
- Between 2 non-metals
- Small electronegativity difference
- electrons are shared
- bonds are directional
- each atom bound to specific atoms
### Polarity
- #### Definition
- #### Finding Polarity
	1. ∆χ = difference in electronegativity between the 2 atoms
	2. Will either fall in Covalent, Polar Covalent, or Ionic Bond
		- **Covalent:** 0 ≤ ∆χ ≤ 0.4
		- **Polar covalent:** 0.4< ∆χ < 1.9
		- **Ionic:** ∆χ ≥ 1.8
- #### Bond Dipole
	- An unequal sharing of electrons
	- In HCl, for example, Cl has a **higher electronegativity** so the electrons are located **closer** to the **Cl nucleus**.

### Lewis Dot Structures
- ###### Basics
	- **Octet rule** - Nonmetals achieve closed valence shels of 8 electrons by sharing electrons
- ###### Exceptions
	- H - has a "duet" (only needs 2 electrons)
	- Elements in Group 3A can sometimes have less than an octet
	- elements in row 3 or below can sometimes have more than an octet
- ###### Steps for Drawing
	1. Count the number of valence electrons
	2. If 2 atoms are present, draw a single bond (2 electrons) between each atom. 
		1. If 3 or more atoms are present, place the least electronegative, non-H atom in the center. 
		2. Then, draw a single bond (2 electrons) between each atom
	3. Place all remaining valence elecrons on atoms as lone pairs
	4. Turn lone pairs into additional bonds to give an octet to every atom that requires it

### Metallic Bonding
- #### Definition
	- "Sea" of valence electrons model
	- Valence electrons are free-flowing and can move from one cation to another
		- This is what holds the ions together
- #### Properties
	- Lustrous/shiny
	- Ductile/malleable
	- Usually high MP/BP
	- Conductive as a solid and liquid
- #### Alloys
	- ###### Definition and Types
		- Mixture of two elements, at least one being a metal
		- **Substitional** - alloying elements are similar sizes
			- ex. brass
		- **Interstitial** - one alloying element fits into the gaps of the other alloying element
			- ex. steel
