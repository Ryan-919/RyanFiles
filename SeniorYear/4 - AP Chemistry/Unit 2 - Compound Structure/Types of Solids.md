## Types of Solids
### Solids
- #### Crystalline
	- ###### Definition
		- repeating, 3d structure
	- ###### Ionic
		- Composed of positive and negative ions held together by electrostatic attractions
		- **Properties**
			- high melting points
			- hard and brittle
			- shatter rather than bend
			- condicuts electricity in aqueous or molten state
	- ###### Metallic
		- Formed by metal atoms. Described as a uniform distribution of atomic nuclei with a "sea" of delocalized electrons
		- **Properties**
			- Held ogether by metallic bonding
			- High electrical and thermal conductivity
			- Lustrous and malleable
			- Wide range of melting points
	- ###### Covalent Network
		- Atoms held together by a network of covalent bonds
		- **Properties**
			- Hard and strong (graphite is an exception)
			- very high melting points, covalent bonds must be broken
			- **ex.** diamond, sand, graphite
		- **Silicon** can bond in this way, its electrons are farther away and doesn't tend to to make double bonds, rather single bonds in a 3d, network structure
	- ###### Molecular 
		- neutral molecules
		- covalent bonds can be solids
		- Strength of attraction depends on size and polarity ([[Intermolecular Forces]])
			- 
- #### Amorphous
	- ###### Definition
		- distorted random atoms
	-
