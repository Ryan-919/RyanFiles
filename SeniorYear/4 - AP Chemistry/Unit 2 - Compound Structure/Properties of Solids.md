## Properties of Solids


|                  | Formation and Structure                                            | Strength                                                                                    | Melting Point                       | Texture               | Conductivity                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Ionic            | Between **ions** and form a crystal lattice structure              | Relatively **strong**, Directly proportional to charge and inversely to atomic radius       | Tend to be **high**                 | Hard, brittle         | Not when solid, but can as liquid |
| Metallic         | Between **metals** and form cation structure with sea of electrons | Relatively **strong**, directly proportional to # of protons and inversely to atomic radius | **High**                            | Hard, malleable       | Highly conductive                 |
| Molecular        | Between **nonmetals** and form from covalent bonds through IMFs    | Relatively **weak** due to being held together by only IMFs                                 | Tend to be **low,** depends on IMFs | Soft, easily crumbled | Not conductive                    |
| Covalent network | Networks formed by covalent bonds (NOT IMFs) (generally C, Si, B)  | Relatively **strong** depending on bond length, ∆χ, atomic size                             | Tend to be **high**                 | Very hard and brittle | Not conductive                    |

SiC, SiO<sub>2</sub>, BN, C by itself are common covalent networks
