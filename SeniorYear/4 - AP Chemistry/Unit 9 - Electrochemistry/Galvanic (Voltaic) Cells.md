>[!Definition]
> Use a thermodynamically favorable reaction to generate an electric current

### Example

#### Zinc and Copper
##### Reactions
###### Half Reactions
$$
\ce{ Zn(s) -> Zn^2+(aq) + 2e- (oxidation)}
$$
$$
\ce{ Cu^2+(aq) + 2e- -> Cu(s) (reduction) }
$$
###### Full Reaction
$$
\ce{ Zn(s) + Cu^2+(aq) -> Zn^2+(aq) + Cu(s) \ ∆G° < 0 }
$$
##### Diagram and Explanation

![[GalvanicCellDiagram]]
###### Left Compartment
- Beaker that contains a 1 M aqueous solution of Zinc Sulfate
- Zinc is **oxidized** 
	- Turns into Zinc 2+ cations 
		- Loses mass
	- Loses electrons
		- These electrons will move through the wire to the right compartment
- Solid zinc is an **anode** (electrode where oxidation takes place)
###### Right compartment
- Beaker that contains a 1 M aqueous solution of Copper Culfate
- Copper is **reduced**
	- Copper 2+ anions react with electrons flowing from anode to form solid copper
- Solid copper is a **cathode** (electrode where reduction takes place)
###### Salt Bridge
- Connects the 2 compartments
- Inside the salt bridge, there is an **electrolyte** (in this case sodium nitrate)
- The solutions in each comparment (AKA a **half cell**) must be neutral in charge
- The purpose of the salt bridge is to **balance the charges**
	- Left Half Cell
		- Over time, the $[Zn^{2+}]$ increases so $NO^-_{3}$ flows in to balance out charge
	- Right Half Cell
		- Over time, the $[Cu^{2+}]$ decreases so $Na^+$ flows in to balance out charge
- **Anions** flow into the **anode**
- **Cations** flow into the **cathode**
###### Voltmeter
- Measures the difference in electric potential between 2 points
- As long there is a difference in electric potential, electrons will flow in the wire
- Eventually the reaction will reach equilibrium
	- At this point, voltage will be 0
	- Current will also be 0
	- No electrons will move in the wire
