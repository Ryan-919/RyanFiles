## Standard Cell Potential

>[!Definition]
>Also known as **Standard Cell Voltage**, this refers to the **voltage** of an electrochemical cell when reactants and products are in their **standard states** at a **particular temperature**
### Examples
#### Zinc and Copper
##### Reaction and E°<sub>cell</sub>
$$
\ce{ Zn(s) + Cu^2+(aq) -> Cu(s) + Zn^2+(aq) }
$$
$$
E°_{(cell) } = = 1.10\ V\ at\ 25°\ C
$$
###### E°<sub>cell</sub>
- ° Refers to the fact that reactants and products are in their standard states
##### Standard States
###### Solids
- Standard state is a pure solid under a pressure of **1 atm**
###### Solution
- Standard state is a 1 M solution

##### Calculating
###### Half Reactions
$$
\ce{ Zn^2+(aq) + 2e- -> Zn(s)\ \ E°_{(red)} = -\ 0.76\ V}
$$
$$
\ce{ Cu^2+(aq) + 2e- -> Cu(s)\ \ E°_{(red)} = +\ 0.34\ V }
$$
###### Reverse Zinc Reaction
- We reverse the Zinc half reaction because it is being oxidized, not reduced
$$
\ce{ Zn(s) -> Zn^2+(aq) + 2e- \ \ E°_{(ox)} = +\ 0.76\ V}
$$
###### Add Half Reactions

$$
\ce{ Zn(s) + Cu^2+(aq) -> Cu(s) + Zn^2+(aq) }
$$
$$E°_{cell} = E°_{red} + E°_{ox}$$
$$E°_{cell} = 0.34 + 0.76 = +1.10\ V$$
