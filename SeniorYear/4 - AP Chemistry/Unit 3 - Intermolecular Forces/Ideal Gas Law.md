## Ideal Gas Law
### Ideal Gas Law
- #### Formula
	- $PV = nRT$
	- ###### P: Pressure 
		- force exerted by particle collision on the interiror surface of the container
	- ###### V: Volume 
		- amount of space occupied by the gas
	- ###### n: Number of Moles
		- amount of gas
	- ###### R: Ideal Gas Law Constant
		- $0.08206\ \frac {L*atm} {mol*K}$
	- ###### T: Temperature in K
		- measurement of kinetic energy of the particles
- #### Relations
	- ###### P and V
		- Inversely proportional if other variables are held constant
		- exponentially
	- ###### P and n
		- Directly proportional
		- linearly
	- ###### P and T
		- Directly proportional
		- linearly
	- ###### Combined Proportionality Formula
		- $P \propto \frac {nT} {V}$
- #### Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures
	- ###### Definition
		- Gases are often a mixture of different particles
		- Each kind of particle exerts its own pressure known as **partial pressure**
		- Ideal gases behave the same regardless of chemical identity
	- ###### Dalton's Law
		- $P_{total} = P_{A}+P_{B}+P_{C}\ +\  ...$
	- ###### Mole Fraction
		- Represented by $X_{i}$
		- Ratio of moles of one gas in a mixture to the total number of moles of gas
		- $X_{i} = \frac {n_{i}} {n_{total}}$
	- ###### Partial Pressure and Mole Fraction
		- Since pressure is directly proportional to the number of moles of a gas:
			- $X_{i} = \frac {n_{i}} {n_{total}} = \frac {P_{i}} {P_{total}}$
- #### Deviations from Ideal Behavior
	- ###### Real gases
		- Refute 2 of Kinetic Molecular Theory's assumptions
			1. Volume of gases is negligible (relative to volume of container)
				- True at low pressures
				- So, at **high pressures**, gases deviate from ideal behavior and actual **volume is larger** than predicted
			2. Gases feel no IMFS (attractions or repulsions)
				- True at high temperatures
				- At **low temperatures**, actual **pressure is smaller** than predicted
