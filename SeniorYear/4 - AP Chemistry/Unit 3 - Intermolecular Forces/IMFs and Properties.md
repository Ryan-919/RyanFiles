## IMFs and Properties
### Properties
- #### Overview
	- Depends on the nature of the interparticle attractions holding together a sample of a pure substance
	- The interparticle attraction depends on
		- The type of bonding
		- If covalent, the type of intermolecular force
- #### Phase changes
	- ###### Boiling point 
		- liquid to gas
		- Increase as IMFs increase
			- more energy is required to counteract the attractive forces
	- ###### Melting point 
		- solid to liquid
		- Increase as IMFs increase
	- ###### Freezing point 
		- liquid to solid
		- Increases as IMFs increase (same as melting point)
- #### Enthalpy
	- ###### Enthalpy of fusion (∆H<sub>f</sub>)
		- energy required to melt
		- Increase as IMFs increase
	- ###### Enthalpy of vaporization (∆H<sub>v</sub>)
		- energy required to vaporize
		- Increase as IMFs increase
- #### Vapor Pressure (VP)
	- ###### Definition
		- Pressure exerted by vapor in equilibrium with a liquid in a closed container at a given temperature
	- ###### Relation to IMFs
		- Inversely proportional
		- Stronger IMFs lower the pressure of the vapor
			- Stronger IMFs favor condensation
	- ###### Relation to Temperature
		- Directly proportional
		- More vapor → more VP
- #### Liquid Properties
	- ###### Viscosity
		- Measure of a liquid's resistance to flow
			- ex. Honey has a higher viscosity than water
		- Increasing IMFs increase viscosity
	- ###### Surface tension
		- The energy required to increase the surface area of a liquid
		- Increasing IMFs increase surface tension
- #### Solubility
	- ###### Definition
		- How well something can dissolve
		- **solute** - what is being dissolved (solid, liquid, or gas)
		- **solvent** - what is dissolving (liquid)
	- **Intermolecular Force** - ion-dipole interaction
	- ###### "Like dissolves like"
		- Nonpolar things dissolve nonpolar things
		- Polar things dissolve polar things
	- ###### Ex.
		- Which dissolves better, CCl<sub>4</sub> or HCl in H<sub>2</sub>0
			- **HCl** - both H<sub>2</sub>O and HCl are polar
		- Which dissolves better, CCl<sub>4</sub> or HCl in C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>14</sub>
			- **CCl<sub>4</sub>** - both C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>14</sub> and CCl<sub>4</sub> are nonpolar
		-
