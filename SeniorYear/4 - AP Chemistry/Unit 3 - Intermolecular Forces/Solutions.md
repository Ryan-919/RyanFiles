## Solutions

### Solutions and Electrolytes
- ###### Aqueous
	- in solution, in water
- ###### Solvation
	- salt surrounded by water, hydration of a salt occurs when the anions are attracted to the positive H and the cations are attracted to the O
- ###### Dissociation
	- ionic salts breaking apart
	- **Ex.** $NH_{4}NO_{3}\rightarrow NH_{4}^{+}\ (aq) + NO_{3}^{-}\ (aq)$
- ###### Ionization
	- molecular compounds dissolving to produce ions
	- **Ex.** $HBr \rightarrow H^{+} + Br^{-}$
		- Most molecular compounds do not create ions but acids do
- ######  Dissolved â‰  Dissociated (or ionized)
	- For example, covalent compounds such as sugar, will dissolve, but not ionize
		- it is not an acid
- #### Electrolytes
	- ###### Definition
		- substances that ionize/disssociate in water
	- ###### Strong electrolytes
		- Dissociate 100% in solutions (no reactant left)
			- **Salts:** increase concentration because more moles of ions per liter
				- NaCl, KBR, MgCl<sub>2</sub>
			- **Strong acids**
				- HCl, HBr, HI, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, HClO<sub>4</sub>, HNO<sub>3</sub>
			- **Strong bases**
				- Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Ca, Sr, Ba hydroxides
	- ######  Weak electrolytes
		- Partial dissociation in solutions
		- The solute still exists as a molecule and not as ions
			- **Weak Acids**
				- $HC_{2}H{3}O{2} \leftrightarrow H^{+} + C_{2}H{3}O{2}^{-}$
				- reversible, only 1% ionized
				- 2 **chemically** distinct H's in acetic acid = only 1 is acidic
			- **Weak bases**
				- $NH_{3} + H_{2}O \leftrightarrow NH_{4}^{+} + OH^{-}$
	- ###### Non-electrolytes
		- molecular substances that are not acids, bases, or salts
			- **Ex.** sucrose
- #### Preparing Solutions
	- ###### From solid to solute
		- Use desired molarity and desired volume to calculate 
		- moles of solute $\rightarrow$ grams of solute
	- ###### From a stock solution: Use M<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub> = M<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub>
		- Stock solution molarity = M<sub>1</sub>
		- Desired molarity = M<sub>2</sub>
		- Desired volume = V<sub>2</sub>
		- Solve for V<sub>1</sub> $\rightarrow$ dilute with water until you reach V<sub>2</sub>
	- ###### Lab techniques
		1. Add solute to volumetric flask
		2. Add small amount of solvent to dissolve substance and swirl
		3. Add solvent to desired volume
