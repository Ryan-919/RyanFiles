## Intermolecular Forces
### Terms
- ###### Intermolecular Forces
	- Forces of attraction between atoms and molecules of a substance
- ######  Polarizability
	- tendency of molecules to generate induced electric dipole moments when subject to an electric field
	- increases with:
		- more electrons
		- bigger molecule with increased surface area
			- **ex.** C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub>
		- π bonding (=/☰)
- ###### Alcohol
	- class of organic compounds characterized by one or more hydroxyl (―OH) groups attached to a carbon atom of an alkyl group (hydrocarbon chain).

| Name                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                  | Molecules                               | Relative Strength                                                                   |

| London Dispersion Forces | Arises due to the temporary fluctuations in the electron distribution within all molecules leading to temporary dipoles.                                                     | all molecules                           | weakest, strength depends on polarizability which depends on size of electron cloud |
| Induced Dipole-Dipole    | Temporary dipoles caused by permanent dipoles inducing a normally nonpolar species                                                                                           | O<sub>2</sub> induced by H<sub>2</sub>O | relatively weak, strength depends on dipole                                         |
| Dipole-Dipole            | Attractions between the positive end of one polar molecule and negative end of another.                                                                                      |                                         | slightly stronger, strength depends on dipole                                       |
| Hydrogen Bonding         | Type of dipole-dipole attraction resulting from the attractive forces between an H atom covalently bonded to a highly electronegative atom and another electronegative atom. | F-H, O-H, N-H                           | strongest, depends on dipole                                                        |
| Ion-Dipole               | Electrostatic attractive force between an ion and a neutral molecule dipole. Similar relation in terms of strength with Coulomb's Law                                        |                                         | Depends on strength of dipole and ion                                               |
| Ion-Ion                  | Another word for ionic bonding. Coulomb's law dictates strength of bond:                       $F_{Coulombic} = \frac {q_{1}q_{2}} {r^2}$                                    | anion and cation                        | Strength depends on charge and atomic radius                                        |
