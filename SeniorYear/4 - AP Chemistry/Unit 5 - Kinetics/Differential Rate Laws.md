## Differential Rate Laws
### Rate Laws
- #### Overview
	- ###### Definition
		- Mathematical expression that describes the relationship between the rate of a chemical reaction and the concentration for reactnats
		- **ex.** $aA + bB \rightarrow Cc + dD$
			- capital letters are actual molecules/elements
			- lower case are coefficients
			- $rate = k[A]^m[B]^n$
				- $[A]$ = concentration of A (reactant)
				- $[B]$ = concentration of B (reactant)
				- k = rate constant = specific for a particular reaction at a particular temperature **independent** of $[A]$ or $[B]$
				- m and n = **reaction orders**
	- ###### Reaction orders
		- Must be experimentally determined
		- **zero order**: changing $[R]$ does not impact
			- $rate =[R]^0=1$
			- uncommon
		- **first order**: changing $[R]$ affects rate by that change
			- $rate = [R]^1=[R]$
			- pretty common
		- **second order**: changing $[R]$ affects rate by square of that change
			- $rate = [R]^2$
	- ###### Examples 
		- **ex. 1**: $rate = k[A]^2[B][C]^0$
			- $rate = k[A]^2[B]$
			- the reaction is **second order** with respect to reactant **A**
			- the reaction is **first order** with respect to reactant **B**
			- the reaction is **zero order** with respect to reactant **C**
			- **Overall reaction order** = sum of individual reactant orders = **3**
		- **ex. 2**: An experiment shows that the reaction of nitrogen dioxide with carbon monoxide is second ordoer in $NO_2$ and zero order in $CO$ at 70Â° C
			- $rate = k[NO_2]^2$
- #### Using data to determine rate laws
	- ###### Overview
		- Differential rate laws always look at rate vs concentration information
		- $A + B \rightarrow product$
		- taking initial reaction rates to avoid complications brought forth by equilibrium and reversible reactions and buildup of products
