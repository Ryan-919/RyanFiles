## Redox Reactions
### Oxidation
- #### Oxidation State
	- ###### Definition
		- number assigned to an element in chemical combination which represents the number of electrons lost (or gained, if the number is negative), by an atom of that element in the compound
	- ###### Oxidation Rules
		- **Element by itself:** 0
		- **Group 1A:** always +1
		- **Group 2A:** always +2
		- **Halogens:** usualy -1, positive with oxygen
		- **Monatomic ion:** ion charge
		- **Al** always +3
		- **H**
			- +1 with nonmetals
			- -1 with metals
		- **O**
			- usually -2
			- -1 in peroxide ($H_2O_2$)
		- **F** always -1
		- Sum of ON's for a neutral compound = 0
		- Sum of ON's for a polyatomic ion = ion charge
### Oxidation/reduction reactions
- #### Overview
	- ###### Definition
		- Reaction that involves the transfer of electrons between two species
		- e<sup>-</sup> lost must equl e<sup>-</sup> gained
	- ###### Oxidation states
		- charge the atom would have if all of its bonds are ionic
	- ###### Oxidation
		- losing e-, becoming +, 
		- increased oxidized state
	- ###### Reduction
		- gaining e-, becoming -, 
		- reduced oxidized state
- #### Examples
	- ###### NaCl synthesis reaction
		- $Na + Cl \rightarrow NaCl$
			- Na gives electrons to Chlorine, ionizing both atoms and attracting them to form NaCl
			- **Oxidation numbers**
				- Na: 0
				- Cl: 0
				- NaCl: +1, -1
			- Na is being oxidized while Cl is being reduced
			- **Half reactions**
				- $Na \rightarrow Na^+ + e^-$
				- $Cl + e^- \rightarrow Cl^-$
	- ###### MgO synthesis reaction
		- $2\ Mg\ (s) + O_2\ (g) \rightarrow 2\ MgO\ (s)$
		- **Oxidation numbers**
			- Initial
				- Mg: 0
				- O<sub></sub>: 0
			- Final
				- Mg: +2
				- O: -2
		- Mg oxidized (lost electrons, charge increased)
		- O reduced (gain electrons, charge decreased)
		- **Half reactions**
			- $Mg \rightarrow Mg^{2+} + 2\ e^-$
			- $O_2 + 4\ e^- \rightarrow 2\ O^{2-}$
		- Combined
			- $2\ Mg + O_2 + 4\ e^- \rightarrow 2MgO + 4\ e^-$
			-
