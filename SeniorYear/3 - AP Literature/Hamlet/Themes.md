#### Hesitation causes more pain. But brashness leads to mistakes.
- ###### Hesitation
	- The more we ponder on something and fear the outcome, the more we trap ourselves in a state of suffering
- ###### Brashness
	- If we act too boldly and become overconfident or allow our emotions to take ahold in these situations, than we may be prone to making critical errors
	- We see Hamlet do this when he kills Polonius and abandons all sense as he strikes through the tapestry 
- ###### Overall 
	- We must keep level-headed and one must strive for a balance between analyzing a situation and deploying action
	- To wait too long is to miss our shot and act too horribly is to blunder it altogether 
#### Blood brings more blood
- ###### Cost of Revenge
	- All characters die because of Hamlet's revenge
	- While he may seem just in his quest for vengeance, there were clear **repercussions** that Hamlet's revenge ultimately causes for everyone else
- ###### No real contentment
	- Hamlet didn't find much satisfaction with his revenge
	- **Revenge** is often a **hollow feeling** that leads us without the bliss we thought we might experience 
		- Instead a feeling of **apathy** or even **guilt**
