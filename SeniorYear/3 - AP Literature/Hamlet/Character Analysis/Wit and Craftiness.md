### Hamlet
- #### Hamlet Outwits Polonius Act 3, Scene 4
	- ###### Setting the Stage
		- Hamlet has been pretending to be mad, and Polonius, the Lord Chamberlain, is tasked by King Claudius to spy on Hamlet to uncover the reason behind his erratic behavior.
	- ###### The Meeting with Gertrude 
		- In this scene, Hamlet confronts his mother, Queen Gertrude, in her chamber. Polonius, hidden behind an arras (a tapestry), eavesdrops on their conversation to gather information.
	- ###### Hamlet's Rhetorical Skill
		- During their conversation, Hamlet speaks in veiled language and uses ambiguous rhetoric. He accuses his mother of complicity in his father's murder and expresses his disdain for her hasty marriage to Claudius.
	- ###### Polonius' Interference
		- Polonius, attempting to protect the queen and to gather more information, speaks out from behind the arras, trying to control the conversation and admonish Hamlet.
	- ###### Hamlet's Reaction 
		- Hamlet quickly realizes Polonius is eavesdropping and decides to toy with him. He makes cryptic comments that hint at violence and madness, keeping Polonius off balance and confused.
	- ###### "Nay, I know not. Is it the King?"
		- One of the key moments of Hamlet's wit comes when Polonius asks if he recognizes him, to which Hamlet replies, "Nay, I know not. Is it the King?" This remark subtly mocks Polonius, suggesting that he is so insignificant that Hamlet doesn’t even recognize him.
	- ###### Continued Banter
		- Hamlet continues to speak in riddles and mock Polonius with double entendres, making it increasingly difficult for Polonius to grasp his true intentions.
	- ###### Hamlet's Departure
		- Eventually, Hamlet ends the conversation abruptly, leaving Polonius baffled and uncertain about what he has learned
	- ###### Summary
		- In this scene, Hamlet's quick wit and rhetorical skill allow him to manipulate the situation to his advantage. He uses ambiguity and clever language to confuse Polonius and assert his own agency, even in the face of Claudius’ spies. This interaction showcases Hamlet's intelligence and ability to navigate complex social dynamics, despite his feigned madness.
- #### Killing of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Act 5, Scene 2
	- ###### Summary
		- Hamlet discovers the king's plot against him and alters the letter ordering his own execution to command the deaths of his former friends instead.
		- This act reveals Hamlet's strategic thinking and his willingness to take decisive action to protect himself and seek revenge for his father's murder. 
	- ###### Disillusionment and Ruthlessness
		- Growing disillusionment and ruthlessness as Hamlet navigates the political intrigue and personal betrayal surrounding him.
	- ###### Seems Out of Character
		- Maybe through killing Polonius (even though by accident), Hamlet acquires a taste for blood and how easy it is to end another life
		- Sign of madness
		- Makes the death of Claudius seem more inevitable
		- Shows that Hamlet is just as bad as Claudius
### Claudius
- ####  Basic overview 
	- ###### Conniving
		- he is able to kill his brother and manipulate Gertrude to marry him despite the death of her husband mere months before
	- ######  Negotiation 
		- Can successfully correspond with the kings of other nations to get what he wants
		- Avoided conflict with Norway by sending ambassadors (Act 2, Scene 2)
		- Uses foreign relation with England by sending Hamlet to England with an order for Hamlet to be executed 
	- ###### Self-Preservation
		- Doesn't physically stop Gertrude from drinking the poision 
		- When she does drink it, he doesn't express much regret 
		- Seems far more preoccupied with his own safety
	- ###### Paranoid
		- To ensure Hamlet dies, he believes he should add poision to the drink
		- Ironically, this is what kills his wife, Gertrude
		- His plan overall also led to his demise
### Polonius
- #### Scheming/Paranoia
	- ######  Spying on Laertes
		- Sends Rinaldo to spy on Laertes while he is abroad to make sure he is not engaging in gambling or drinking
		- While it may seem like he is doing it out of concern for his son's well-being and reputation, this shows that he does not trust his own children 
	- ###### Warding off Ophelia
		- Also shown through warding off Ophelia from Hamlet's advances
	- ###### Lack of Regard for Ophelia
		- Uses Ophelia as a pawn to bait Hamlet into a dialogue to determine if he's mad
		- Willing to puter her daughter in the presence of a potential madman to prove a point in front of King Claudius
