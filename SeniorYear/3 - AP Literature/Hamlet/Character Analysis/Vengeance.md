- #### Overall Theme
	- ###### Massive cost of Revenge
		- Virtually everyone in the play dies as a result of it
		- Hamlet's increasing desperation sees him killing Polonius
			- causing Ophelia to kill herself
			- causing Laertes to agree to Cladius' plan which sees
				- Laertes kill Hamlet
				- Hamlet kill Laertes
				- Gertrude getting caught up in it
				- Hamlet kill Claudius
		- While revenge might feel sweet in the act of plotting, it is equally true that more people end up getting hurt because of it
		- Also shows that the sweetness of revenge is likely bittersweet 
			- at least for Hamlet who dies knowing that his vengeance has brought about the death of so many
