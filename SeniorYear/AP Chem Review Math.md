### Atomic Structure and Periodicity
#### Wong Chemistry Super Problem
##### a)
>[!Problem]
An atom of hydrogen emits a discrete wavelength of electromagnetic radiation at 486 nm as the electron transitions from a higher energy level back to the second energy level n = 2. Calculate the energy change, in joules, associated with this transition.

$$
E = hv
$$
$$
c = \lambda v
$$
$$
E=\frac{ch}{\lambda}
$$
$$
E = 4.087 \times 10^{-19}\,\ J
$$
##### b)
>[!Context]
>A second discrete emission line in an atom of hydrogen has a wavelength of 434 nm as the electron transitions from a higher energy level back to the second energy level (n = 2).
###### i)
>[!Problem]
>Would the change in energy associated with the 434 nm spectral line be greater
than, less than, or equal to, that of the 486 nm spectral line? Justify your answer.

The energy change would be **greater** than that of the 486 nm because wavelength is inversely proportional to energy change.

###### ii)
>[!Problem]
>Would the energy level (n) of the electronic transition responsible for the 434 nm
spectral line be at a higher energy level or lower energy level than that of the 486
nm spectral line? Justify your answer.

The energy level would be at a higher energy level because a greater change in energy is required with the shorter wavelength.

##### Context for C-E
>[!Context]
>In a separate experiment a molecule of hydrogen, $H_{2}$, absorbs a photon of electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength of 300 nm. The energy required to break the bond in $H_{2}$ gas is $432\,\ kJ\,\ mol^{-1}$.

##### c)
$$
c=\lambda v
$$
$$
v=\frac{c}{\lambda} = 9.99\times 10^{14} \,\ s^\text{-1}
$$
##### d)
$$
\frac{{432\,\ kJ}}{1\,\ mol} \times \frac{{1\,\ mol}}{6.022 \times 10^{23}\,\ molecules} \times \frac{{10^3\,\ J}}{1\,\ kJ} = 7.18 \times 10^{-19}\,\ \frac{J}{molecule}
$$
##### e)
$$
E=\frac{ch}{\lambda} = 6.621 \times 10^{-19}\,\ J
$$
Since the energy of the photon is less than the energy to break the bond in a molecule of $H_{2}$ gas, it **does NOT** have enough energy to break the bond.
##### f)
Two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen are required to form water because the 2 hydrogen atoms fill the valence shell of the oxygen atom and vice versa. To get a complete octet, the oxygen must share 2 electrons. The PES data shows that each hydrogen atom has one valence electron and each oxygen has 6. 
##### g)
The peak farthest to the right
##### h)
1.31 MJ/mol
##### i)
Oxygen has 1 pair of electrons in its p orbital while nitrogen has all of its 3 electrons in the p orbital unpaired. Oxygen's piar of electron increases electron-electron repulsion which decreases the energy needed to ionize oxygen.
##### j)
Middle peak labeled 2.45
##### k)
$$
3\,\ H_{2}+N_{2} \to 2\,\ NH_{3}
$$
##### l)
###### i)
$$
PH_{3}
$$
###### ii)
Atoms of phosphorus have more energy levels and electrons. The valence electrons of phosphorus occupy the $3p^6$ sublevel while those of nitrogen occupy the $2p^6$ sublevel. The greater sublevels are farther from the nucleus.
### Bonding, Lewis Structures, and Molecular Geometry
#### Wong Chemistry Super Problem
##### b)
$XeF_{4}$ has 2 lone pairs present around the central $Xe$ atom. This means that while $CF_{4}$ has a tetrahedral shape wtih bond angles of approximately $109.5°$, the lone pairs in the $XeF_{4}$ atom cause the shape to be square planar. $XeF_{4}$ has 6 electron dense regions (2 more than $CF_{4}$'s 4).
##### c)
$sp^{3}$ hybridized
##### d)
$XeF_{4}$ is nonpolar because the electron dense regions are distributed equally so there is no net dipole moment. The square planar shape leads to individual dipoles canceling each other out.
##### e)
$As$ can form an expanded octet because it has d orbitals which $N$ does not have.
##### f)
5 sigma bonds 0 pi bonds
##### g)
The first Leqis structure better represents a molecule of hydrazine because the formal charge on the 2 nitrogen atoms in the first one is 0 while the formal charge for the 2 nitrogen atoms in the second one is +1.
##### h)
$\Delta H°_{rxn}$ = bonds broken - bonds formed
$$
-1169 = 160+4(BE_{N-H})+2(154) - 4(565)-941
$$
$$
x=391\,\ \frac{kJ}{mol}
$$
##### i)
The average kinetic energy would be the same because they are both at the same temperature and that is what determines average kinetic energy of a molecule.

### Intermolecular Forces
#### Wong Chemistry Super Problem
##### a)
###### i)
Butanone has London dispersion forces, dipole dipole forces (since it is polar)
###### ii)
n-butane has only London dispersion forces
##### b)
Since Butanone is polar while n-butane is nonpolar, butanone would be more soluble in a polar substance like $H_{2}O$. This means that butanone has similar intermolecular interactions to water and can form dipole-dipole interactions with water while n-butane can't.
##### d)
The enthalpy of vaporizaiton will be greater than $32.2\,\ kJ\,\ mol^{-1}$ because of it's stronger intermolecular forces. n-butanol has hydrogen binding forces which are stronger than both dipole-dipole and london dispersion forces. This means the enthalpy of vaporization will be greater.
##### e)
$NaCl$ and $KCl$ have ionic bonds which are stronger than the dipole-dipole forces that attract $PCl_{3}$ atoms together. More energy is required to break ionic bonds. $NaCl$ has a greater melting point than $KCl$ the distance between $Na$ and $Cl$ is lower than the distance between $K$ and $Cl$. According to Coulomb's Law, the square of the distance between 2 charges is inversely proportional to their attractive forces. Therefore, the shorter distance between Na and Cl means that Na and Cl are more strongly attracted and more energy is required to overcome the forces.
##### f)
Noble gases only have London dispersion forces. Since london dispersion forces are stronger when an electron cloud is more polarizable and an electron cloud is more polarizable when there are more electrons, xenon must have stronger london dispersion forces than neon because it has more electrons. The stronger attractive forces means a higher boiling point.
##### g)
Xenon has stronger intermolecular forces from its more polarizable electron cloud from its greater number of electrons. This means that the strength of its intermolecular forces are closer to the intermolecular forces of water. Water has dipole dipole forces and london dispersion forces, meaning it has stronger intermolecular forces. Therefore, since Xenon has stronger IMFs than neon, it will be more soluble in water.
##### h)
It would be less than that of xenon because it has weaker attractive forces because it has less electrons and therefore a less polarizable electron cloud and therefore weaker london dispersion forces. 
##### i)
Argon would have a greater vapor pressure because its boiling point is lower than xenon's. This is because it has weaker attractive forces because it has less electrons and therefore a less polarizable electron cloud and therefore weaker london dispersion forces. It would require less energy to overcome these attractive forces. More of Argon would be vapor meaning higher vapor pressure.
